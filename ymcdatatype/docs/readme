This extension contains datatypes that have a rather universal usage and do
not belong to a specific extension.

Overview of datatypes
=====================

ymccontentinfo
 Displays a predefined static text in the object edit dialog. The static text
 is given in the class edit dialog.

ymcdate
  compatible to ezbirthday, stores dates

ymcdatetime
  stores DateTime objects with timezones

ymcdomain
  stores a domain name either with or without subdomain. The storing could
  also have been done by a simple string datatype. But our datatype includes
  functionality to check the given input and accepts only valid domain
  strings.

ymcenhancedselection 
  allows to select predefined content nodes. The object is then automatically
  stored below the selected nodes. We use this to for example to assign videos
  to categories, where the categories a simple nodes in the content tree.
 
ymcinstantmessenger 
  Let the user enter a nick for a predefined im service.

ymcipv4
  Simply store an IPv4 (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx) as a string in the db.

ymcmschapv2
  Stores LM-/NT-passwords.

ymcnumberasstring
  Stores integer number of a predefined maximum length as strings.

ymcsoarecord

ymcuniquestring
 saves a string, but accepts the string only if it is unique in all objects of
 the same type.

ymcvolume
ymcweight

ymcCountry
==========

This extension adds a dataype called "Country" to your eZ publish, which than
can be used to select a country from a drop-down list by creating an object.
This dataype uses the ISO 3166-3 standard to store the country definition in
the database and is fully translatable using a standard translation.ts.
Country definitions can be changed by just adapting a configuration files,
which eliminates the need of hacking templates.

Configuration
-------------

You can define a country, which than will be preselected for new objects:

In the configuration file      in section       change
ymccountry.ini                 [Default]        DefaultCountry
   
To select e.g. Norway as the default country, change
 DefaultCountry=false
to
 DefaultCountry=NOR

If you prefer not to preselect a country set:
 DefaultCountry=false

Know issues
-----------

The ISO 3166-3 might be outdated or is missing some countries. You can get a recent
definition from http://www.iso.org (price is around CHF 72).
